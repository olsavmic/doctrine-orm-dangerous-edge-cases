# Beware of Entity Inheritance (performanceissue)
## Problem:

When entity has relation to another entity that is part of Inheritance hierarchy, then loading the owning entity will cause additional query to determine which subclass should be loaded

â†’ Additional query for each entity in the result-set! (possibly thousands)

## Solutions:

- You **usually do not need inheritance**
- Manually add `JOIN` and `SELECT` to the `DQL` queries (`tests/src/InheritanceCausesAdditionalQuery/Solution/OccurrenceTest.php`)
